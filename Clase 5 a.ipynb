In this situation, you can be confronted with a decision to collect data from repositories or similar sources, or collect your own data to answer an ad-hoc research question. The latter case will make you consider if you need a probabilistic or non-probabilistic design; which will also determine the next steps in your design.\n","In any case, you need to collect data to be read by R or Python, unless your data is not suitable for any kind of computational data processing. But in this unit, I am assuming it is. If you have collected your data, a popular choice to record your observations is an spreadsheet, maybe using Excel or GoogleDocs. If you have collected data from another party, you may also have spreadsheets, or more sophisticated files in particular formats, like SPSS or STATA. Maybe you decided to collect data from the web, and you may be dealing with XML or JSON formats; or simply text without much structure.
